# üîê Advanced Encryption Tool (AES-256)

This is a Python-based graphical application that allows users to **encrypt and decrypt files using AES-256 encryption**, derived from a password-based key. The tool provides a **simple and intuitive GUI** using Tkinter and implements **strong encryption algorithms** using the `cryptography` library.

## üõ°Ô∏è Features

- AES-256 encryption with password-based key derivation (PBKDF2 + SHA-256)
- Encrypts any file (text, image, zip, PDF, etc.)
- Decrypts only with the correct password
- GUI interface using Python‚Äôs `tkinter`
- Secure random salt generation
- Original files are preserved; outputs are saved as `.enc` and `.dec` versions

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` ‚Äì for GUI
- `cryptography` ‚Äì for AES encryption (`Fernet`, `PBKDF2HMAC`)
- `base64`, `os`, `hashlib` ‚Äì for key derivation and file handling
